Campus Connect(Basic Details):
This a basic social media app for university students. I'm using Instagram UI. And signing up students with enrollment number and registeration number.
Format for registeration number: J12P345678 (Use your own number)
Format for enrollment number: 12R/34567 (Use your own number)

My firebase database is running you can use your own by changing API numbers in main.dart

This is a setup mainly for android (Fully responsive) and basic setup for web (Basic Responsive).
I do not have mac that's why this is not for iOS but you can set it up.
